Project Steps : 
1.  Get computer choice:
    create function named getComputerChoice = > will return "rock" or "paper" or "scissors"
    test the function in console.log

2. Get human choice
    Create function getHumanChoice => will return on of valid choices depending on user inputs
    use prompt method
    test the function

3. Declare the players score variables
    Create twe new variables named humanScore and computerScore
    Initialize them to 0

4. Write the logic to play a single round
    Create a new function named playRound
    Define two parameters (humanChoice and computerChoice)
    Make humanChoice function case-insensitive
    playRound must console.log the winner. Example : "You lose! Paper beats Rock"
    Increments the humanScore or computerScore based on the round winner 

5. Write the logic to play the entire game of 5 rounds.
    Write function playGame that calls playRound to play 5 rounds, keeps track of the scores and declares a winner at the end
    Create new function playGame
    Move playRound function and score variables so that they're declared inside of playGame function
    Play 5 rounds by calling playRound 5 times
